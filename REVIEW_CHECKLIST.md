- ✅ Editable titles (click to edit)
- ✅ Copy to clipboard (question, response, or both)
- ✅ Markdown rendering with optimized spacing
- ✅ Hover tooltips showing timestamps
- ✅ Deleted entries shown with opacity and strikethrough

### API Endpoints

- ✅ GET /api/sections - List sections
- ✅ POST /api/entries - Create entry
- ✅ GET /api/entries - List/search with filters
- ✅ GET /api/entries/{id} - Get detail
- ✅ PATCH /api/entries/{id}/title - Update title
- ✅ PATCH /api/entries/{id}/favorite - Toggle favorite
- ✅ PATCH /api/entries/{id}/deleted - Toggle deleted
- ✅ POST /api/errors - Log error

### Database
- ✅ Sections table with session tracking
- ✅ Conversations table with IsFavorite and IsDeleted columns
- ✅ ErrorLogs table for diagnostics
- ✅ Performance indexes on frequently queried columns
- ✅ Foreign key constraints

## Bug Fixes Verified ✅

### Critical Bugs Fixed
- ✅ Claude Code v2.0.8 transcript parsing (format change handled)
- ✅ Conversation ordering (newest first in sections)
- ✅ Overflow issues (right panel word-wrap)
- ✅ Whitespace trimming (questions and responses)
- ✅ Markdown spacing optimization
- ✅ Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C handling)

## Deployment Readiness ✅

### Build and Publish
- ✅ **build-and-publish.bat** - Automated build script with error handling
- ✅ Web app publishes to C:\Apps\ClaudeLog.Web
- ✅ Hook publishes to C:\Apps\ClaudeLog.Hook.Claude
- ✅ Both projects build successfully in Release mode

### Configuration
- ✅ Production port: 15088 (matches hook configuration)
- ✅ Development port: 15089 (VS 2022)
- ✅ Database connection string configured
- ✅ Windows Integrated Security (no passwords)

### Hook Integration
- ✅ Hook configured in Claude Code settings.json
- ✅ Stop event handler implemented
- ✅ JSONL transcript parsing working
- ✅ API endpoint connectivity confirmed
- ✅ Error logging to database

## Testing Status ✅

### Verified Functionality
- ✅ Hook successfully logs conversations
- ✅ Web UI displays conversations correctly
- ✅ Search functionality working (300ms debounce)
- ✅ Filters working (deleted, favorites)
- ✅ Inline buttons toggle status correctly
- ✅ Title editing saves correctly
- ✅ Copy to clipboard functions
- ✅ Pagination loads more entries
- ✅ Markdown rendering displays properly

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries)
- ✅ XSS protection (HTML escaping in UI)
- ✅ Local-only deployment (localhost)
- ✅ Windows Integrated Security (no credentials in code)

### Not Implemented (Future)
- ⚠️ No authentication/authorization (local use only)
- ⚠️ No HTTPS (HTTP only for local deployment)
- ⚠️ No input validation on hook (trusts Claude Code)

## Recommendations for Team Review

### What to Test
1. **Installation** - Follow README.md setup steps on a fresh machine
2. **Database Setup** - Run schema.sql and indexes.sql
3. **Build Process** - Run build-and-publish.bat
4. **Hook Integration** - Configure Claude Code and test logging
5. **UI Functionality** - Test all buttons, filters, search, and pagination
6. **Error Scenarios** - Test with database offline, invalid data, etc.

### What to Look For
1. **Code Clarity** - Are comments helpful? Any confusing sections?
2. **Documentation Accuracy** - Does README match actual behavior?
3. **Performance** - Does pagination and search feel responsive?
4. **UI/UX** - Is the interface intuitive? Any usability issues?
5. **Error Handling** - Are errors logged properly? Good error messages?

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Review and approve all code changes
- [ ] Test on clean environment
- [ ] Verify database backup strategy
- [ ] Document any environment-specific settings

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Create ClaudeLog database on SQL Server

3. [ ] Run Scripts/indexes.sql
4. [ ] Run build-and-publish.bat
5. [ ] Configure Claude Code settings.json
6. [ ] Start ClaudeLog.Web.exe
7. [ ] Test with a sample conversation

### Post-Deployment
